To fix the unexpected behavior, ensure that the parent element has an explicitly defined width. Additionally, check for any other CSS properties that might affect the parent element's width. You can also use `min-width` or `max-width` to prevent the element from becoming too small or too large.  Avoid using percentages with `calc()` in cases of nested or complex layouts where the parent widths are not well-defined.
